<h3>Background</h3>
<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
	Our client runs a law office, specializing in Estate Planning.  A website was built for him several <br> 
	years ago, but was neglected. The site is extremely simple but severely outdated with non-functional <br> 
	or poorly crafted components.<br>

<h3>Scope</h3>
<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
	Our project will create a new website, following a similar structure with updated and added features.<br>
	<br> 
	Updated features:
	<li>"Service" tiles to open in same page instead of generating a new page</li>
	<li>Updated employee photos and Bios</li>
	<li>Updated website photos</li>
	<li>Updated location to include embedded, interactive map</li>
	<li>Updated navigation bar to include drop-down menues</li>
	<br>
	Add features:
	<li>Secure login</li>
	<li>Document upload/download</li>
	<li>Articles of Interest page</li>
	<br>
	The project goal is to provide an updated website for the law office that will specifically<br>
	address the issues involved with transmitting sensitive documents, while providing additional<br>
	functionality for the user.<br> 
	<br>
